  <p id="metalic"> The role of women in society has been greatly overseen in the last few decades but now are coming to a more perspective to people.
    In the early days women were seen as wives who were intended to cook, clean, and take care of the kids.
    They were not allowed to vote while men took care of having jobs and paying any bills that had to be paid.</p>
